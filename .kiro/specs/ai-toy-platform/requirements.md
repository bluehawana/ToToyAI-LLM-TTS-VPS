# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ToToyAI is an AI-powered plush toy platform designed for the Swedish and EU market. The system embeds AI capabilities into traditional plush toys, enabling natural voice conversations with children. The platform consists of embedded hardware (motherboard, speaker, dual 18650 batteries) inside toys that communicate with self-hosted backend services (LLM and TTS) running on a VPS. The primary language is English, with core features including weather queries, storytelling, singing songs, and educational Q&A (math, general knowledge).

## Glossary

- **ToToyAI**: The complete AI toy platform including hardware and software components
- **Toy Device**: The physical plush toy containing embedded electronics (motherboard, microphone, speaker, batteries)
- **Backend Server**: Self-hosted VPS services handling LLM inference and TTS generation
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: AI model that processes user queries and generates conversational responses
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: Service that converts text responses into natural-sounding audio
- **STT (Speech-to-Text)**: Service that converts user voice input into text for processing
- **Wake Word**: A specific phrase that activates the toy's listening mode
- **Session**: A continuous interaction period between a child and the toy
