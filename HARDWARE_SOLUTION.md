## 🔊 Audio Processing Pipeline

### On-Device (ESP32):

```
1. Microphone → I2S Input
2. Audio Buffer (16kHz, 16-bit)
3. Wake Word Detection (Edge Impulse)
4. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
5. Audio Streaming → Backend via WiFi
```

### Backend Processing:

```
1. Receive audio stream
2. Speech-to-Text (Whisper API or Groq)
3. Intent Detection & LLM Response
4. Text-to-Speech (Edge TTS)
